  <h3>üöÄ FEATURE ARTICLE</h3>
  <p>
    Artificial Intelligence is no longer just a buzzword‚Äîit's a revolution that is reshaping every industry it touches. From smart assistants and autonomous cars to medical diagnosis and predictive analytics, AI is enhancing our lives in ways once considered science fiction. In 2025, we're seeing even greater integration of AI into daily operations, where machines not only assist but also learn, adapt, and make decisions in real-time. This shift is helping businesses improve accuracy, speed, and customer experience like never before.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond automation, AI is becoming a true collaborator in creative industries‚Äîwriting, designing, even composing music. As AI models grow more advanced, they offer tools for human-AI collaboration, boosting creativity instead of replacing it. Meanwhile, ethical development remains key: fairness, transparency, and accountability are shaping responsible AI innovation. The future is not about AI replacing humans, but humans working smarter‚Äîwith AI.
